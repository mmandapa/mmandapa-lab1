Your Tasks:
1. Create and clone a new repository:
Create a new repository on github.com and name it the following: [CRUZID]-lab1
For example, if my cruzID was student, I would name my repository student-lab1
Make sure your repository is set to private, then navigate to the repository settings page and click on collaborators. Share your repository with the following users: Brenda Aceves, Dane Jeffs and annmsasi within your repository settings, then collaborators. 
 
Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.  Setting-up your project
Open VSCode:
First, open VSCode within your computer
Next, open your newly-created repository within step1

Create the required folder structure:
Within your repository, create three new folders: datetime, greeting and quarterly-goals
Within each folder, add an index.html and styles.css file.
Your directory structure should resemble the following:

Install Live Server (VSCode Extension):
If you do not already have the Live Server extension installed, open the extensions tab in VSCode (located on the right toolbar).
Search for Live Server and install the first option in the search results. This extension will allow you to launch a development server and view your HTML/CSS web pages as you work.
After installation, a "Go Live" button will appear in the bottom right of VSCode. Ensure you select the correct folder for the component you wish to view (e.g., selecting the datetime folder to view the datetime component). Refresh the page after making changes to see the updates
 

3.  Implementation
Develop each component separately:
Implement the Greeting, Datetime, and Quarterly Goals components in their respective folders, ensuring each folder contains only the related componentâ€™s code.
Use the Figma link provided to view the design details of each component (e.g., sizes, fonts, colors). You may need to create a Figma account to access the designs.

Within each folder, include the implementation for the respective component (ex: the greeting folder should only contain your implementation of the greeting component)

While working on the implementation, you may find it helpful to see the following figma linkLinks to an external site., to see more details about the component such as the size and font used. You may need to sign up for a figma account before being able to access the link. 
 

4.  Using Figma (Optional, but highly recommended)
After signing up for Figma, you will gain access to the design for the three components. You can view specific design details, including the selection colors, in the right sidebar

Activating "dev-mode" within Figma (available next to the share icon) will provide detailed CSS properties for the components. For beginners, we recommend focusing primarily on the font-size, font-weight, (and width/height property only for the first component ), as Figma often suggests more properties than necessary, which can be harmful to beginners at CSS

5.  Submission
Here, only submit your GitHub repository containing the HTML and CSS files for all three components. Make sure to commit and push all of your changes before submitting.
